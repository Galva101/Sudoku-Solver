# Sudoku-Solver

This program is designed to solve a given sudoku using recursive calls that implement backtracking.

Java and C versions done, Python upcoming.
Also note, in the middle of the *Solve* method: should the print statement be included, performance will be reduced, so only do so if you really want to.
